# CSC437

This is a course project for CSC437 at Cal Poly SLO by [Sreshta Talluri](https://github.com/sreshtalluri).

## Event Planner

This project is a web application that allows users to plan events. As of now, it allows users/hosts to view details and information regarding an event, as well as view information about venues, restaurants, photographers, and photographers.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory
3. Run `cd packages/server`
4. Run `npm install` in the server directory
5. Run `npm run dev` in the server directory

**NOTE:** Since I have already ran `npm run build` once, I have included a prebuilt version of the project in the `packages/proto/dist` directory. So, if you want to run the project, you just have to run `npm run dev` in the server directory.
